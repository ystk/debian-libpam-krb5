libpam-krb5 (4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The meaning of use_authtok has changed in this version to only affect
  the new password when changing passwords.  If you were using this
  parameter in the auth group, you should now use force_first_pass
  instead.  If you were using it in the password group, you should add
  try_first_pass, use_first_pass, or force_first_pass depending on how you
  want to handle prompting for the old password.  use_authtok in the auth
  group will temporarily be treated as equivalent to force_first_pass for
  backwards compatibility.
