libpam-krb5 (4.6-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Drop version qualifications on Build-Depends that are satisfied by
    stable.  Drop version qualifications on Depends that are satisfied by
    oldstable.
  * Add the upstream release signing key and verify it in debian/watch.
  * Prefer *.tar.xz in debian/watch to match packaging.
  * Convert debian/copyright to copyright-format 1.0.
  * Specify the Debian packaging branch in the Vcs-Git control field.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.5 (no changes required).

libpam-krb5 (4.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patch to add AM_PROG_AR to configure.ac, now apparently
    required by Automake for the binutils in unstable.  (Closes: #713296)
  * Apply upstream patch to build with largefile support.  This is
    probably pointless for this module, but consistency is good.
  * Canonicalize the Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser URLs.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.4 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Jun 2013 12:33:04 -0700

libpam-krb5 (4.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New anon_fast option to attempt anonymous authentication and use
      those credentials to provide FAST armor.  (Closes: #626509)
    - New user_realm option to set the realm for unqualified user
      principals without changing the default realm for all other
      operations.
    - New no_prompt option to suppress PAM prompting in favor of letting
      the Kerberos library handle it.  (Closes: #626506)
    - New silent option that duplicates the behavior of PAM_SILENT.
    - New trace option for preliminary support of Kerberos trace logging.
    - Fix the doubled colon in password prompts from Heimdal.
    - Preserve the realm of the authentication identity when forming an
      alt_auth_map identity.
    - Allow the alt_auth_map format to contain a realm to force all mapped
      principals to be in that realm.
    - Avoid a NULL pointer dereference if krb5_init_context fails.
      (LP: #998525)
    - Close memory leaks in search_k5login and alt_auth_map.
    - Suppress bogus error messages about the realm option.
    - Retry authentication under try_first_pass for several other error
      conditions.
  * Regenerate the Autotools build system with dh-autoreconf.
  * Add krb5-config to Build-Depends so that the test programs don't abort
    with errors about not having a Kerberos configuration.
  * Switch to xz compression for the upstream and Debian tarballs.
  * Enable parallel builds.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.3 (no changes required).

libpam-krb5 (4.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enable bindnow hardening flags and fix the syntax of the
    DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS setting.
  * Bump debhelper dependency to 9 now that compatibility mode V9 is no
    longer experimental.
  * Move single-debian-patch to local-options and patch-header to
    local-patch-header so that they only apply to the packages I build and
    NMUs get regular version-numbered patches.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 04 Feb 2012 13:27:02 -0800

libpam-krb5 (4.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix build rule to not override CPPFLAGS, which deactivates some of the
    options passed in by dpkg-buildflags.  Instead, use --with-krb5-lib
    and --with-krb5-include to locate the Kerberos headers and libraries.
    Thanks, Moritz Muehlenhoff.  (Closes: #654293)

libpam-krb5 (4.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cherry-pick upstream patch to fix initialization of krb5_deltat
    defaults on systems where krb5_deltat is not a long.  Should fix FTBFS
    on s390x.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Dec 2011 16:36:21 -0800

libpam-krb5 (4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - The temporary root-only ticket cache is now stored relative to
      ccache_dir rather than hard-coded to be in /tmp.
    - Suppress the notice that the password is being changed because it's
      expired if force_first_pass or use_first_pass are set in the
      password stack.
    - Confirm the password can get kadmin/changepw credentials before
      returning the status code indicating it's expired, working around a
      bug in old Heimdal versions that return expired even for incorrect
      passwords.
    - Better error reporting of authorization (such as .k5login) failures.
    - Prefer the change password protocol when linked with MIT libraries
      for better compatibility with older KDCs.
    - Improve logging and authorization when defer_pwchange is set.
    - Close some memory leaks.
    - Report symbolic names of PAM flags in debug logging.
  * Enable compiler hardening flags.
  * Remove "v5" from the long description.  Kerberos v5 has been the
    default version of Kerberos for over ten years.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Dec 2011 17:34:03 -0800

libpam-krb5 (4.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the pam-auth-update configuration to skip remaining password
    stack by default modules if the Kerberos password change succeeds.
    This is more useful behavior for the common case of Kerberos accounts
    not having local passwords.  See README.Debian.gz for information
    about how to synchronize Kerberos and local passwords.  (LP: #826989)
  * Update README.Debian.gz documentation with more current options for
    pam_unix and document password synchronization configuration.
  * Convert to multiarch.  Depend on the multiarch version of libpam0g,
    install the modules into the multiarch version of /lib/security, and
    declare the packages Multi-Arch: same.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V9 (experimental).
    - Build-Depend on debhelper 8.9.4 or later for hardening flags.
    - Add Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.2 (no changes required).
  * Fix formal name of the GPL in debian/copyright.  (This will also be
    done upstream in the next release.)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Sep 2011 08:40:43 -0700

libpam-krb5 (4.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add the architecture to the library path for heimdal-multidev and
    krb5-multidev since the *.so symlinks were moved in 1.5.dfsg.1-1 and
    1.9.1+dfsg-2 respectively.  (Closes: #642688)
  * Tighten build dependencies on heimdal-multidev and krb5-multidev
    accordingly.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Sep 2011 14:09:36 -0700

libpam-krb5 (4.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Do not prompt for a password when try_pkinit is set, removing a
      spurious password prompt introduced in 4.1, but partly reintroducing
      a bug causing the password to not be saved in the PAM data if
      authentication falls back to password after a PKINIT failure.
    - Organize the pam_krb5 man page into sections.
  * Fix custom patch header to refer to pam-krb5, not remctl.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.1.
    - Refer to the GPL version 1 now that it's in common-licenses.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V8 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Feb 2011 13:07:05 -0800

libpam-krb5 (4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New fast_ccache option, which if set attempts to use credentials in
      that ticket cache to protect the Kerberos authentication with FAST.
      Requires FAST support in the Kerberos libraries and hence only is
      available in libpam-krb5, not libpam-heimdal, for right now.
    - Fix error in freeing a previous alt_auth_map setting.
  * Switch to 3.0 (quilt) source format.  Force a single Debian patch and
    include a custom patch header explaining that it is a rollup of any
    fixes cherry-picked from upstream and breaking those patches out
    separately would be work for no gain.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 09 Jun 2010 18:08:04 -0700

libpam-krb5 (4.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build libpam-krb5 and libpam-heimdal from the same source package.
  * Acknowledge libpam-heimdal NMU.
    - Rebuild against current Heimdal libraries.  (Closes: #559779)
    - Add support for pam-auth-update.  (Closes: #551455)
  * Lower libpam-heimdal priority to extra, since it conflicts with
    libpam-krb5 and the MIT Kerberos version will be sufficient for most
    users.
  * Fix spelling error in manual page.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.4 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 03 Feb 2010 23:41:39 -0800

libpam-krb5 (4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New fail_pwchange option which treats expired passwords like
      authentication failure and suppresses password change.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Nov 2009 17:37:03 -0800

libpam-krb5 (4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix return status for pam_setcred for ignored users and non-Kerberos
      logins to return success.  Returning failure breaks PAM
      configurations using jumps, since modules doing jumps become
      required on the pam_setcred pass through the auth group.
    - During the second pass through the password group, always prompt for
      and store the new password even if the user is ignored.  This is
      required to allow this module to be stacked with another module that
      uses use_authtok.  Thanks, Steve Langasek.  (Closes: #545824)
    - Log successful authentications with priority LOG_INFO.
    - Log failed authentications with priority LOG_NOTICE.
    - Use pam_syslog for logging and rationalize all logging to follow the
      Linux PAM recommendations.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Nov 2009 16:09:05 -0800

libpam-krb5 (4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Add force_first_pass parameter to auth and password groups to force
      use of the password in the PAM data even if none is set, replacing
      part of the old meaning of use_authtok.
    - use_authtok now only affects the new password during password
      change, although use_authtok in the auth group has the old meaning
      for backward compatibility.  (Closes: #549188)
    - use_first_pass and try_first_pass no longer affect how the new
      password is obtained during password changes.
    - Stop returning PAM_IGNORE from pam_setcred.  This confuses older
      versions of the Linux PAM library.
    - Better logging in pam_sm_{open,close}_session.
  * Add try_first_pass to the pam-krb5 password group pam-auth-update
    configuration.  Unlike the previous behavior, this means that if the
    Kerberos password is different than the password of an earlier module
    in the password group, pam-krb5 will now prompt the user for the
    Kerberos password.
  * Remove the libtool *.la file and set the permissions of pam_krb5.so
    properly to work around the annoyances of switching to libtool.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.3 (no changes required).

libpam-krb5 (3.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix a segfault if pam-krb5 is configured with use_first_pass or
      use_authtok and there is no stored password.  Thanks, Jonathan
      Guthrie. (Closes: #537729)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Jul 2009 09:24:26 -0700

libpam-krb5 (3.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Always treat an empty password as an authentication failure rather
      than passing it to the Kerberos libraries, which may treat it as no
      password and prompt without our knowledge.  This prompting could
      lead to authenticating with a password unknown to the PAM stack,
      which could cause unexpected problems in some PAM configurations.
    - Fix error handling if ticket cache creation fails.  (LP: #395938)
  * Mention the PAM autoconfiguration support in README.Debian.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Jul 2009 15:56:45 -0700

libpam-krb5 (3.13-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Urgency medium for RC bug fix.
  * Tighten the dependency on libpam-runtime to ensure that
    pam-auth-update is available.  While it was introduced in Ubuntu at
    1.0.1-4ubuntu1, Debian didn't introduce it until 1.0.1-6.  Thanks,
    Steve Langasek.  (Closes: #537416)
  * Update standards version to 3.8.2 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Jul 2009 00:02:42 -0700

libpam-krb5 (3.13-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Return PAM_IGNORE for ignored users in pam_chauthtok instead of
    PAM_PERM_DENIED.  This change is necessary for the pam-auth-update
    configuration to work properly.  Thanks, Steve Langasek.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Jun 2009 14:38:10 -0700

libpam-krb5 (3.13-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enable pam-auth-update support.  libpam-krb5 will now automatically
    configure pam_krb5 in the PAM common-* configuration unless it has
    been edited by the local administrator.  Thanks to Steve Langasek for
    the implementation.  (Closes: #520793)
  * Rewrite debian/rules to use overrides and depend on debhelper 7.0.50.
  * Change section to admin to match override.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.1 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Jun 2009 17:52:58 -0700

libpam-krb5 (3.13-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.

libpam-krb5 (3.13-1) experimental; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
    - SECURITY (CVE-2009-0360): If invoked in a setuid context, ignore
      user environment variables that specify the local keytab and
      Kerberos configuration.  Protects against a privilege escalation
      vulnerability.
    - SECURITY (CVE-2009-0361): Protect against applications calling
      pam_setcred with PAM_REINITIALIZE_CREDS as root in a setuid
      context.  This API call is designed to reinitialize an existing
      Kerberos ticket cache and therefore trusts the KRB5CCNAME
      environment variable, but in a setuid context, this may allow
      overwriting arbitrary files.
  * Install the upstream NEWS file as an upstream changelog.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to the package dependencies.
  * Improve wording for the GPL pointer.  The package may be distributed
    under any version of the GPL.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Feb 2009 10:47:51 -0800

libpam-krb5 (3.12-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New alt_auth_map, force_alt_auth, and only_alt_auth options to map
      usernames to alternative Kerberos principals for authentication.
    - Log to authpriv, not auth.
    - Correctly log an exit status of ignore during debugging.
    - Document ssh session requirement.  (Closes: #492039)
    - Document ignore handling with [] actions.  (Closes: #492379)
  * Update to debhelper compatibility mode V7.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization except for configure.
    - Let the upstream Makefile do the installation.
  * Remove NEWS.Debian, only of interest in upgrades from sarge.

libpam-krb5 (3.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix double-free of the cache data structure if cache creation fails
    while opening a session or setting credentials.  (LP: #257826)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 13 Aug 2008 23:36:54 -0700

libpam-krb5 (3.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - setcred, open_session, and acct_mgmt now return PAM_IGNORE instead
      of PAM_SUCCESS for ignored users or non-Kerberos logins.
    - New defer_pwchange option for fully correct expired password
      handling.  This is not the default because it will open security
      holes in badly written applications.
    - New force_pwchange option to force password change for expired
      accounts during the authentication step even if the Kerberos library
      doesn't support this.
    - Warn if more than one of use_authtok, use_first_pass, and
      try_first_pass are set and use the strongest.
    - Remove workaround for older MIT Kerberos that improperly initialized
      the credential option structure.  The workaround was causing
      problems for PKINIT with the current libraries (which fix this bug).
    - Set explicit hidden visibility for all local symbols and further
      restrict the visible symbols with a version script, removing leaks
      of symbols into the application namespace.
  * Install NEWS as the upstream changelog.  Upstream no longer includes a
    detailed CHANGES file.
  * Rewrite and expand debian/copyright based on the upstream LICENSE
    file.
  * Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.0 (no changes required).

  * New upstream release.
    - If no_ccache is set, don't fail if we can't find module data.
    - Better error handling when reading keytabs.
  * Document in README.Debian that accounts must still exist in
    /etc/shadow when following the standard configuration and suggest an
    alternate configuration when that isn't appropriate.  Thanks, Raoul
    Borenius.  (Closes: #452592)

libpam-krb5 (3.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - If use_authtok is set, fail if we retrieve a NULL password, since
      that's how pam_cracklib rejects passwords.  (Closes: #447306)
    - Add clear_on_fail option to clear the password on failed password
      change to force later password modules using use_authtok to fail.
    - Fix parsing of the keytab PAM option.
    - Return PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL when unable to resolve the realm.
    - Additional debugging information in README.
  * Add Homepage control field.

libpam-krb5 (3.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Read verification principal from keytab if given one explicitly.
    - Don't store context data until after authentication has succeeded,
      fixing behavior when stacking multiple invocations in different
      realms.
    - Use pam_modutil_getpwnam for better thread safety.
    - Don't store PAM data unless saving a ticket cache.
    - Restore safer linker flags, broken with the last release.
  * Swap Sam and I as maintainer and uploaders.  I'm now upstream and the
    primary maintainer.

libpam-krb5 (3.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - When search_k5login is enabled but the user doesn't exist locally,
      fall back on standard Kerberos authentication instead of always
      failing.  Fix other error handling issues with search_k5login.  This
      fixes non-exploitable segfaults with unknown users.
    - Clear ticket options when changing passwords.  (Closes: #440050)
    - Fix and document username canonicalization.  (Closes: #437171)

libpam-krb5 (3.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix compilation errors with Heimdal.  (Closes: #413553)
    - Document that ChallengeResponseAuthentication must be enabled in
      sshd to prompt users to change expired passwords.  (Closes: #411816)
    - Support specifying a keytab other than the system keytab to use to
      verify passwords.  (Partly addresses #399002)
    - New ticket_lifetime, banner, and expose_account config options.
    - Honor PAM_SILENT where appropriate.
    - Prefix the default cache type with FILE: to be explicit.
    - If PAM_USER is set to a fully-qualified principal that the Kerberos
      library can map to a local account name, reset PAM_USER to that
      local account name after authentication.
    - Return better PAM error codes for authentication failures.
    - Fix various memory leaks and memory handling problems.
    - Better error message handling with later Kerberos releases.
    - Various improvements to debug logging.

    - Incorporated all Debian packages into the upstream release.
    - Added new use_authtok, ignore_k5login, minimum_uid, and
      renew_lifetime configuration options.  (Closes: #360601, #355970)
    - Support setting some options in krb5.conf.
    - Better support for password changing, including more correct saving
      of passwords in the PAM stack, support for initial checks, and
      better behavior as part of a password change stack.
    - Fall back to the default ticket cache when reinitializing
      credentials without a KRB5CCNAME setting.
    - Understand the FILE: prefix to Kerberos ticket caches when
      initializing the cache.  (Closes: #381849)
    - Improved support for the no_ccache option.
    - Rewritten and significantly improved documentation.
    - Use standard Kerberos library calls for ticket validation.
    - Add a trailing nul to the password in the prompter function,
      matching the behavior of the default Kerberos prompter.
    - Extensive code, error status, memory, and namespace cleanup.
  * Improve the package long description, removing the misleading caution
    about use with network services.
  * Update standards version to 3.7.2 (no changes required).
  * Add build-arch and build-indep rulies just in case.

libpam-krb5 (1.2.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only call krb5_kuserok when the account to which we're authenticating
    is a local account to allow use of pam_krb5 for application
    authentication of users without local accounts.  (Closes: #354133)
  * Restructure the code to do user validation after obtaining their
    initial tickets.  This eliminates a lot of confusing special cases and
    deferred checking and makes it easier to audit the code.
  * Don't create the ticket cache until after successful authentication.
    Otherwise, we leave files behind in /tmp.
  * Document what principals libpam_krb5.so looks for in the system keytab
    to do ticket validation.  (Closes: #350556)

libpam-krb5 (1.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Always use a disk cache for temporary storage of credentials and cope
    with not having module-specific data during pam_sm_setcred by passing
    the cache path in an environment variable.  This is required to cope
    with OpenSSH's technique (when using ChallengeResponseAuthentication)
    of doing PAM authentication in a child process and then opening the
    session in the parent.  (Closes: #339734)
  * Only initialize the ticket cache once no matter how many times setcred
    is called.  Saves duplicate work and works around a bug in xdm, which
    calls setcred repeatedly and discards the environment set by the final
    call.
  * Don't assume we already have a context when changing passwords; passwd
    doesn't work that way.  (Closes: #344003)
  * Fix the test for the new password.  I don't think this would have
    worked at all before.
  * Improve debugging output for password changes.
  * If search_k5login is specified but no .k5login is found, still check
    the user with krb5_kuserok in case there are custom principal mappings
    defined.
  * Handle ignore_root in a cleaner fashion and add support for
    ignore_root on password changes.
  * Depend on krb5-config.  (Closes: #342271)
  * Document that ccache and ccache_dir must be specified as options to
    the session module.  (Closes: #341926)
  * Document that pam_sm_authenticate and pam_sm_setcred also call
    krb5_kuserok.
  * Properly override the upstream CFLAGS so that debugging builds work.
  * Don't ignore errors from make clean.
  * Providing binary-indep in debian/rules is required by Policy even if
    there are no arch-independent packages.  Whoops.

libpam-krb5 (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream maintainer and version.
    - Now supports reinitialization of credentials properly, allowing
      programs such as xlock to refresh credentials.  (Closes: #309345)
      This currently only works with versions of xlock that try to refresh
      credentials (xlockmore does not).
    - Do not include the principal name in the prompt.  This breaks some
      SSH clients and isn't necessary.  (Closes: #321319)
    - New ignore_root option to skip this module for root authentication,
      ameliorating pam_krb5 problems when the network is down.  Partially
      addresses #315622.
  * Bug fixes to upstream version (all sent back to the maintainer):
    - Succeed silently in account management if Kerberos wasn't used.
    - Parse ccache_dir correctly.
    - Bring the man page up to date.
    - Link with -z defs to ensure all symbols were found.
  * Readd the ccache option with a better implementation and allow for
    randomization of the filename using mkstemp even if ccache is used.
  * Add search_k5login option to allow authentication based on the
    principals listed in ~/.k5login when the local account name doesn't
    easily map to the Kerberos principal.
  * Add specific configuration recommendations to README.Debian.
  * Install upstream changelog now that there is one.
  * Add a watch file.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.2 (no changes required).
  * Remove maintainer from uploaders; dak can handle this properly.
  * Update uploader address.
  * Remove unnecessary code from debian/rules.

libpam-krb5 (1.0-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert the PAM_REINITIALIZE_CREDS change as it breaks sshd with
    UsePAM.  Add a source comment explaining the confusion about the
    meaning of this flag.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Wed, 13 Apr 2005 16:01:45 -0700

libpam-krb5 (1.0-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Return PAM_CRED_UNAVAIL to PAM_REINITIALIZE_CREDS as the apparently
    most appropriate error message.  (Closes: #191001)
  * Remove reference to non-existant man page pam.conf(8) and change
    pam(8) to pam(7).  Thanks, Nik A. Melchior.  (Closes: #271066)
  * Include the user UID in the default ticket cache name so that rpc.gssd
    and similar programs can find the ticket cache.  Document the random
    string in the default ticket cache name in the man page.  Thanks,
    Steinar H. Gunderson.  (Closes: #295027)
  * Really remove stray ex.doc-base.package file.

libpam-krb5 (1.0-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Free authentication context used to prevent KDC spoofing, fixing a
    file descriptor leak.  Thanks, Martin Kögler.  (Closes: #194542)
  * Fix use_first_pass and try_first_pass for password changes and report
    password change errors via the PAM conversation.  Thanks, Martin Mares.
    (Closes: #133461)
  * Return PAM_USER_UNKNOWN and PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL where appropriate
    when authenticating.  Thanks, Roland Bauerschmidt.  (Closes: #239399)
  * Add missing includes to eliminate warnings.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.1.
    - Build with -g -O2 by default and support requesting no optimization.
  * Simplified the build system.  The copy of source files into a
    subdirectory isn't needed since we don't apply patches at build time,
    so the package can be built normally with a regular make invocation.
  * Be sure not to pass -I/usr/include to the compiler.
  * Updated the build system to debhelper 4.
    - Removed unneeded call to dh_suidregister.
    - Use dh_installman rather than dh_installmanpages.
  * Flesh out the package description.
  * Removed stray ex.doc-base.package file.
  * Refer to /usr/share/common-licenses in debian/copyright for the GPL
    and remove dh_make boilerplate language.

libpam-krb5 (1.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * New version that supports sessions management.  You may want to use
    this to write out credentials at session managemment time, for example
    so they can be used  by openafs.

 -- Sam Hartman <hartmans@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Dec 2000 17:02:18 -0500

libpam-krb5 (1.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Wildcard enctype matching so that you don't have to have a des-cbc-md5
    key.  Previously, if you did not have a des-cbc-md5 key, it looks like
    the code might not verify the ticket against the key, treating it as
    if you had no local key and blindly trusted the KDC.  In practice this
    is not an issue with most Kerberos setups.
  * Test against pam service keys like imap rather than just the host
    service key.  We still prefer host to service keys.

 -- Sam Hartman <hartmans@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2000 17:49:12 -0500
